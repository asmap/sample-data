# sample-data

Sample data from ASmap sources (RPKI, IRR, etc) for research and test purposes.

The folders have the same epoch as their name suggests. To validate their data, use [kartograf](https://github.com/asmap/kartograf) and do `./run map -r /path/to/here/1742127147 -t 1742127147` for example.
